**B.E.E.T.** (**B**ot **E**xtremeño de **E**ventos **T**ecnológicos) is a project created to promote tech events in Extremadura. It gathers information about them at [beet.tech](http://beet.tech) and schedules retweets at [@botbeet](http://www.twitter.com/botbeet) to promote them.

Why this? Extremadura is a big region but not very populated and it lacks of a hub (physical or digital) which joins the activity organized by a wide range of actors (university, local development groups, foundations, etc.). B.E.E.T. tries to help them to advertise their activities.

B.E.E.T. has been developed with HTML, SASS and CSS. For further information, please check [its Github](https://github.com/csuarez/beet-web) (currently only in Spanish).
