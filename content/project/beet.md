**B.E.E.T.** (**B**ot **E**xtremeño de **E**ventos **T**ecnológicos) is a project created to promote tech events in Extremadura. It gathers information about them at [beet.tech](http://beet.tech) and schedules retweets at [@botbeet](http://www.twitter.com/botbeet) to promote them.

Why this? Extremadura is a big region but not very populated and it lacks of a hub (physical or digital) which joins the activity organized by a wide range of actors (university, local development groups, foundations, etc.). B.E.E.T. tries to help them to advertise their activities.
